This project is based on Saybolt-Viscometer experiment.
This experiment shows the relationship between viscosity with respect to temprature.
In this project we just havr to input the experimental readings. 
This project will calculate values from the readings we have entered and will gives us the relationship graph between viscosity with respect to temprature.
In Short we just have to input the experimental reading and it will give the outputs of the experiment with the graph.
